# Deploy your first app

Klave is built to make your life as easy as possible when creating application for confidential computing.

At the moment Klave leverages on a git developer workflow and is able to connect directly to your GitHub repository
 to detect and automatically deploy changes brought to your applications.

## Create a scaffold

We will first start by using the Klave NPM package to scaffold a small app automagically.

<Steps>
### Prerequisites: Check you have Node installed (node >=v20)
    ```bash copy 
    node -v
    v20.9.0
    ```
 
### Scaffold your Klave application
<Tabs items={["npm", "npx", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm create on-klave
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npx create on-klave
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn create on-klave
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
 
### Follow-up instructions

```

### Move to the application directory and get your code ready
 
</Steps>

## Develop your app

Once the scaffold has been created you will find the template application in the `/apps/hello_world` folder.

#### What's included

The `hello_world` app contains two methods:
- A transaction to store data in the ledger: `storeValue`
- A Query to fetch the data stored in the ledger: `fetchValue`

You can build you application locally to check that everything is in order and that Klave will compile your code successfully.

#### Build your application (Optional)

```bash copy
yarn build
```


## Deploy to Klave

Once you've made the changes you wanted you're ready to deploy. This can be done in a couple easy steps:

<Steps>

### Push your folder on a [GitHub](https://github.com/home) repository

<Tabs items={["Github cli", "Git"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    gh repo create
    git add .
    git commit -m "your commit message"
    git push --set-upstream origin master
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  First create a new repo on your GitHub.
    ```bash copy 
    git remote add origin git@github.com:username/your-repo.git
    git branch -m main
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
    git add .
    git commit -m "your commit message"
    git push
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install the Klave GitHub application

For Klave to react to your repository's commits and pushes you will need to install [Klave's GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/klave-network) from the marketplace.

Don't worry, if you forget this step Klave will invite you to do so later.

<Image src="/resources/install-github-app.png" alt="Install the Klave GitHub app" style={{ margin: "auto", padding: "4rem 0 4rem 0"}} height={700} width={700} />

### Connect your GitHub repository

Make sure you are logged-in to [Klave](https://app.klave.com/login), the navigate to [Deploy now](https://app.klave.com/deploy)

<Image src="/resources/connect-to-github.png" alt="Connect to GitHub" style={{ margin: "auto", padding: "4rem 0 4rem 0"}} height={700} width={700} />

After selecting your organisation, Klave will scan to find your repo.

<Image src="/resources/select-your-project.png" alt="Scan to find your repo" style={{ margin: "auto", padding: "4rem 0 4rem 0"}} height={700} width={700} />

### Select you app and click on enable

You may need to select the application you want to deploy in case you have more than one in you repo.

<Image src="/resources/select-your-app.png" alt="Select the app you want to deploy" style={{ margin: "auto", padding: "4rem 0 4rem 0"}} height={700} width={700} />

### App will deploy

Congratulations ! You app is now queued for compilation and deployment. In a few seconds your application will be ready to use !

</Steps>


## Test your app deployment

The Klave UI provides a few tools to help test out you application. Navigate to your deployment and explore your registered queries and transactions.

### Try to Store and Fetch value from the Ledger

    Use the `storeValue` transaction to store a a key value pair in the Ledger:
    ```json
    {"key":"myKey", "value":"myValue"}
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "success": true
        }
    ]
    ```
    Use the `fetchValue` query to get a value from the Ledger:
    ```json
    {"key":"myKey"}
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "success": true,
            "value": "myValue"
        }
    ]
    ```
