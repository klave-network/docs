Klave provide access to a cryptographic primitives for your applications. All cryptographic primitives provided by the Klave SDK are hardware accelarated and are always executed from within the secure enclave.
The SDK exposes two different interfaces that can be used depending on your use cases.

## Simple Crypto Interface

The Simple Crypto interface exposes basic crypto primitives and key management for :
- Encryption leveraging AES-GCM 256 keys
- ECDSA leveraging NIST P-256 keys
- Digest leveraging SHA2

All keys generated are stored in the application ledger and can be reused easily, for more information check here : 

## Subtle Crypto Interface

The Subtle Crypto interface is more advanced and follow loosely the WebCrypto API. With this you can :
- Create and manage cryptographic key lifecycle (AES, RSA, ECC)
- Manage encryption and decryption (AES-GCM, RSA-OAEP)
- Manage signature and verification (ECDSA, RSA-PSS)
- Manage key wrapping and unwrapping (AES-KW, AES-GCM)
- Import and export keys with standard format (SPKI, PCKS1, PCKS8, SEC1, RAW)
- Generate digest
- Generate randomness

The Subtle Crypto Interface can be use either in the context of queries or transactions as users control the key lifecycle. For more information check here :
