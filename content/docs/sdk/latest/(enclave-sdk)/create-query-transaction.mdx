## Defining Query and Transaction

Your application deployed on Klave is a collections of query and transaction functions. Klave SDK provides a simple way to declare query and transaction functions.

### Declaring a Transaction Function
<Tabs groupId="language" items={["AssemblyScript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tab value="AssemblyScript">
    The transaction template function in Klave can take up to one parameters and the return type is always `void`.
    To declare a transaction function in your app with the SDK you just have to decorate the method signature as follow:
    ```js copy
    /**
     * @transaction
     */
    export function myTransaction(): void {
        //develop your transactional logic here
    }

    /**
     * @transaction
     */
    export function myTransactionWithInput(input: InputType): void {
        //develop your transactional logic here
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Rust">
    In Rust, The transaction template function in Klave take exactly one `string` argument and the return type is always `void`.
    App in Rust are built as a wasm component. Therefore transaction function have to be declared within the Guest implementation of the Component.
    
    In addition, as opposed to AssemblyScript that can use annotations to register transaction, for Rust an extra step of registering is needed by calling `add_user_transaction`  within the `register_routes` function.
    
    ``` rust
    mod bindings;
    use bindings::Guest;
    use klave;
    struct Component;

    impl Guest for Component {
        // Function to declare to register Transaction and Query
        fn register_routes(){
            klave::router::add_user_transaction("my_transaction");
        }

        fn my_transaction(cmd: String){
          //develop your transactional logic here
        }
    }
    ```

    Rust application are built as a wasm component and need to expose a `wit` interface to export the registered `transaction`.

    ``` rust
    package component:klave-rust-app-example;

    /// An example world for the component to target.
    world klave-rust-app-example {
        //The exported route name need to use `-` instead of `_` by convention in the `.wit` file
        export register-routes: func();
        export my-transaction: func(cmd: string);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

### Declaring a Query Function
<Tabs groupId="language" items={["AssemblyScript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tab value="AssemblyScript">
    In a similar fashion the query template function in Klave can take up to one parameters and the return type is always `void`.
    To declare a query function in your app with the SDK you just have to decorate the method signature as follow:

    ```js copy
    /**
    * @query
    */
    export function myQuery(): void {
        //develop your query logic here
    }

    /**
    * @query
    */
    export function myQueryWithInput(input: InputType): void {
        //develop your query logic here
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Rust">
    In a similar fashion the query template function in Klave take one `string` parameter and the return type is always `void`.
    App in Rust are built as a wasm component. Therefore query function have to be declared within the Guest implementation of the Component.
    
    In addition, as opposed to AssemblyScript that can use annotations to register query, for Rust an extra step of registering is needed by calling `add_user_query`  within the `register_routes` function.

    ``` rust
    mod bindings;
    use bindings::Guest;
    use klave;
    struct Component;

    impl Guest for Component {
        // Function to declare to register Transaction and Query
        fn register_routes(){
            klave::router::add_user_query("my_query");
        }

        fn my_query(cmd: String){
          //develop your query logic here
        }
    }
    ```

    Rust application are built as a wasm component and need to expose a `wit` interface to export the registered `query`.

    ``` rust
    package component:klave-rust-app-example;

    /// An example world for the component to target.
    world klave-rust-app-example {
        //The exported route name need to use `-` instead of `_` by convention in the `.wit` file
        export register-routes: func();
        export my-query: func(cmd: string);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Input Parameters Management

<Tabs groupId="language" items={["AssemblyScript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tab value="AssemblyScript">
    if your unique input parameter is not a native type then you have to declare and decorate it accordingly.

    ```js
    @serializable
    export class InputType {
        success!: boolean;
        message!: string;
    }
    ```
    The serialisation and deserialisation of the input are automatically managed by the Klave SDK.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Rust">
    In Rust, user defined function declared can only accept a single `string` parameters.
    
    You can pass `json` formatted `string` and then use `json` library such as `serde_json` to deserialize within your function.
