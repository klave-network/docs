## Secure Connection Protocol (SCP)

Klave implements a Secure Connection Protocol ([SCP](/learn/architecture#secure-connection-protocol-scp)) which provides validatable direct access to your applications.

You can refer to the protocol above to implement your own custom connectors.
However, Klave provides ready-to-use TypeScript and Python connectors that can be utilized on both
the server and client sides (including web browsers, IoT devices, etc...).

### Documentation

-   Discover how to quickly connect to your application on Klave in the [Quickstart Connect section](/quickstart/connect) using TypeScript or Python
