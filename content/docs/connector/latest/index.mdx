## Secure Connection Protocol (SCP)

Klave implements a Secure Connection Protocol ([SCP](/learn/architecture#secure-connection-protocol-scp)) which provides validatable direct access to your applications.

You can refer to the protocol above to implement your own custom connectors.
However, Klave provides ready-to-use TypeScript and Python connectors that can be utilized on both
the server and client sides (including web browsers, IoT devices, etc...).

### Documentation

-   Discover how to use the TypeScript or Python packages to quickly connect to your application on Klave in the [Quickstart Connect section](/quickstart/connect)
-   Connect to Klave cluster using an ephemeral key or by importing an existing key in the [Connecting section](/connector/latest/connection)
-   Call a Query or apply a Transaction within this [section](/connector/latest/query-transaction)
-   Discover more [APIs](/connector/latest/scp-apis)
