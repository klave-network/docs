## What is a Trustless PaaS?

Klave introduce the innovative concept of Trustless Platform as a Service that is a variant of Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is designed to provide an execution environment for application that is privacy enabling, ensuring computational and data integrity at all time and providing attestation, technical evidence and cryptographic proof to enable verifiability by the user.

### Klave as a Trustless PaaS

In a nutshell, Klave Trustless PaaS provides a reliable and secure infrastructure on which individuals, businesses, and organisations can build and run their applications without fear of interference from the platform provider or other third party. Ultimately, Klave aims to bring back accountability to the business code.

Similarly to classic PaaS provider Klave allows the deployment of stateful application with any level of complexity (full turing completeness). It manages scalability, replication and full application lifecycle from commit to deployment.

Klave's infrastructure, build upon cutting edge hardware powering secure hardware enclave, is managed by the Klave team.

### Key Characteristics of Klave Trustless PaaS

- **Data integrity & Privacy** - Klave is designed to prioritise data privacy by default and by design. Data are always kept secret and tamper-proof at all time (including from the platform provider). This ensures data integrity and confidentiality at platform level.

- **Falsification resistance & Computational integrity** - Klave prevent tampering with the code deployed by design. This ensures that the code deployed is the code intended by the user and provides a high level of assurance that the code has not been altered. Code execution on Klave cannot be altered ensuring that the code is executed as intended and that there is no malicious code injected during execution.

- **Verifiability & Honesty** - Klave provides attestation, technical evidence and cryptographic proof every step of the way verifiable by the user. Evidence that the application's code deployed is the one intended, attestation that the application is running within a secure hardware enclave, cryptographic proof that execution happened as intended through transaction and query signature.
