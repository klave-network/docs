The "Quickstart" section is designed to help new community members start developing on Klave using standard tools for trustless apps development. The goal is to provide an easy guide to follow with step-by-step instructions.

Topics covered:

-   Setting up a development Environment
-   Compiling and Deploying a trustless applications
-   Interacting with applications on Klave

What **won't** be covered:

-   An in-depth guide to developing trustless applications
-   Klave's architecture

## Prerequisites
<Tabs groupId="language" items={['AssemblyScript', 'Rust']}>
    <Tab value="AssemblyScript">
        Trustless applications are developed in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) and compiled in [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
        [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) needs to be installed beforehand to be able to use the sdk. For a smoother experience the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) can be used.
        The [Klave SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-on-klave) provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new trustless applications using typescript.
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Rust">
        For deploying Rust applications on Klave you will need to have the The [Rust Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (incl. rust, rustup, cargo), Cargo component : `cargo install cargo-component`, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`) installed.
        [Git](https://git-scm.com/) needs to be installed beforehand to be able to use the sdk. For a smoother experience the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) can be used.
