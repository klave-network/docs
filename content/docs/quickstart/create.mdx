Klave is built to make your life as easy as possible when creating application for confidential computing.

At the moment Klave leverages on a git developer workflow and is able to connect directly to your GitHub repository
to detect and automatically deploy changes brought to your applications.

## Create a scaffold

We will first start by using the Klave NPM package to scaffold a small app automagically.

<Steps>
	<Step>
        ### Prerequisites: Check you have Node installed (node >=v20)
        ```bash copy
        node -v v20.9.0
        ```
    </Step>
	<Step>
		### Scaffold your Klave application
		<Tabs items={['npm', 'npx', 'yarn']}>
			<Tab value="npm">
            ```bash copy
            npm create on-klave
            ```
            </Tab>
			<Tab value="npx">
            ```bash copy
            npx create on-klave
            ```
            </Tab>
			<Tab value="yarn">
            ```bash copy
            yarn create on-klave
            ```
            </Tab>
		</Tabs>
	</Step>
	<Step>
		### Follow-up instructions
        ```ansi
        ✅ What is the npm package name? ...
        ✅ What is the name of your trustless application? ...
        ✅ How would you describe the trustless application? ...
        ✅ What is the name of the author? ...
        ✅ What is the email address of the author? ...
        ✅ What is the URL to the author's GitHub profile? ...
        ✅ What is the URL for the repository? ...
        ```
	</Step>
	<Step>
        ### Move to the application directory and get your code ready
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Develop your app

Once the scaffold has been created you will find the template application in the `/apps/hello_world` folder.

#### What's included

The `hello_world` app contains two methods:

-   A transaction to store data in the ledger: `storeValue`
-   A Query to fetch the data stored in the ledger: `fetchValue`

	height={700}
	width={700}
/>

You can build you application locally to check that everything is in order and that Klave will compile your code successfully.

#### Build your application (Optional)

```bash copy
yarn build
```

## Deploy to Klave

Once you've made the changes you wanted you're ready to deploy. This can be done in a couple easy steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Push your folder on a GitHub repository

    <Tabs items={['Github CLI', 'Git']}>
        <Tab value="Github CLI">
            ```bash copy
            gh repo create git add . git commit -m "your commit message" git push --set-upstream origin master
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="Git">
            First create a new repo on your GitHub.
            ```bash copy
            git remote add origin git@github.com:username/your-repo.git
            git branch -m main
            git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
            git add .
            git commit -m "your commit message"
            git push
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the Klave GitHub application

        For Klave to react to your repository's commits and pushes you will need to install [Klave's GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/klave-network) from the marketplace.

        Don't worry, if you forget this step Klave will invite you to do so later.

        <Image
            src="/resources/install-github-app.png"
            alt="Install the Klave GitHub app"
            style={{ margin: 'auto', padding: '4rem 0 4rem 0' }}
            height={700}
            width={700}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Connect your GitHub repository

        Make sure you are logged-in to [Klave](https://app.klave.com/login), the navigate to [Deploy now](https://app.klave.com/deploy)

        <Image
            src="/resources/connect-to-github.png"
            alt="Connect to GitHub"
            style={{ margin: 'auto', padding: '4rem 0 4rem 0' }}
            height={700}
            width={700}
        />

        After selecting your organisation, Klave will scan to find your repo.

        <Image
            src="/resources/select-your-project.png"
            alt="Scan to find your repo"
            style={{ margin: 'auto', padding: '4rem 0 4rem 0' }}
            height={700}
            width={700}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Select you app and click on enable

        You may need to select the application you want to deploy in case you have more than one in you repo.

        <Image
            src="/resources/select-your-app.png"
            alt="Select the app you want to deploy"
            style={{ margin: 'auto', padding: '4rem 0 4rem 0' }}
            height={700}
            width={700}
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### App will deploy

        Congratulations! You app is now queued for compilation and deployment. In a few seconds your application will be ready to use!

        <Image
            src="/resources/automatic-deployment.png"
            alt="Select the app you want to deploy"
            style={{ margin: 'auto', padding: '4rem 0 4rem 0' }}
            height={700}
            width={700}
        />
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Test your app deployment

The Klave UI provides a few tools to help test out you application. Navigate to your deployment and explore your registered queries and transactions.

	height={700}
	width={700}
/>

### Try to Store and Fetch value from the Ledger

    Use the `storeValue` transaction to store a a key value pair in the Ledger:
    ```json
    {"key":"myKey", "value":"myValue"}
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "success": true
        }
    ]
    ```
    Use the `fetchValue` query to get a value from the Ledger:
    ```json
    {"key":"myKey"}
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "success": true,
            "value": "myValue"
        }
    ]
    ```
