## The Klave Platform

Klave is a cloud application platform (PaaS) providing privacy-enabling and zero-trust characteristics for WebAssembly-based applications.
It enables you to create attestable tamper-proof trustless applications with guaranteed execution protected by secure hardware and cryptography at scale, in the cloud and without any infrastructure setup or maintenance required.
Klave aims to integrate natively within your developer workflow enabling you to develop and deploy applications with just a `git push`.

### Klave in a Nutshell

Klave is a next generation Trustless Platform as a Service (PaaS). Klave's open platform is designed to enable integrity and privacy in a world where trust is hard to come by. It provides a reliable and secure infrastructure on which individuals, businesses, and organisations can build and run their applications without fear of interference from the platform provider or other third party. Klave provides an execution environment for applications with the insurance that code is run as intended and guarantees that third parties (including the platform provider) cannot alter the code prior to execution and observe it during execution. In addition, Klave enable privacy use cases as data are always kept secret (including from platform provider) at all time. Klave brings honesty to the very fabric of the web by providing technical evidence and cryptographic proof, enabling verifiability every step of the way, systematically.

#### Confidential Computing meets Distributed Ledger Technology

Klave is built upon a next generation Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) called Secure-Enclave Distributed Ledger Technology (SDLT) that combines the power of Confidential Computing with DLT. The combination of these technologies achieves information confidentiality and produces proof that the integrity of the process has not been compromised. Klaveâ€™s SDLT is a high-performance ledger and transactional system, capable of supporting any application and serving a wide range of purposes.

#### Confidential Computing as a Platform, Made Simple

Technologies behind confidential computing are complicated and not accessible to all developers. To keep developers focus on their critical business code, Klave hides away all complexity ensuring that all applications deployed runs within secure hardware enclaves, are distributed by default, and that associated ledgers stays encrypted and tamper proof at all time. As a bonus, It also enables Confidential computing use cases from the get-go.

#### An Open Platform for Composable Apps

Klave makes it easy for developers to develop, deploy and manage applications by integrating natively within their workflow and by enabling them to code in the language they love the most. In addition, Klave focus on transparency by being open-source and accompanying the development lifecycle from the gpg commit signature of the developer to the applications versioning and packaging.

#### A Platform Honest by Design

On Klave you can verify and attest every step of the way that what is happening is what is expected. We call that an honesty machine. By leveraging on privacy enhancing technology and advanced cryptography, Klave provide technical evidence and proof of honesty systematically.

### Vision

Klave empowers developers and companies to create tamper-proof trustless applications protected by secure hardware and cryptography; expanding the boundary of sensitive data management and sovereign data ownership.

#### Focus on building trustless
Trust is essential to all relationships, whether they are personal, institutional, or business. Establishing trust is expensive, slow, and cumbersome. It can also be riddled with human errors and inconsistencies. Many recent scandals confirms that trust is often breached and abused in the worst kind of way.

"Trust, but verify." as the famous adage says. But what if to remediate, we had to **Trust Less**?

Imagine a world where you could interact with others without having to worry about being cheated or deceived. A world respectful or your privacy where you could verify that your data are safe and secure. A world more honest where you could attest that the systems you rely on were working as intended.

Recent developments in the field of Confidential computing and trusted execution environments, represent a unique opportunity to bring forth a new category of cryptographically secure, highly available, trustless systems with unparalleled performances.

A technology that will generalize the principle of falsification resistant computations and ledgers while guaranteeing integrity and privacy.

A technology that will revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us and ultimately bring honesty into the very fabric of the web.

Join us in building the future of trust. "Don't trust, just verify!" Meet **Klave**!
